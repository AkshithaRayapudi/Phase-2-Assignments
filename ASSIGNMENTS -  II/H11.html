               <p>Rolex is a Swiss luxury watch manufacturer founded in 1905 by Hans Wilsdorf and Alfred Davis. It is
                    one of the most renowned and prestigious watch brands in the world, known for its quality,
                    craftsmanship, and iconic designs. Rolex watches are often seen as status symbols and are highly
                    sought after by collectors and enthusiasts.
                    Rolex produces a wide range of wristwatches catering to various purposes, including diving,
                    aviation, sports, and formal occasions. Some of its most famous watch models include the Rolex
                    Submariner, Rolex Daytona, Rolex Datejust, Rolex GMT-Master II, and Rolex Day-Date. These watches
                    are known for their durability, accuracy, and timeless aesthetics.

                    automatically changing date, the Datejust, in 1945.
                    Due to their high demand and limited production, Rolex watches often retain their value well over
                    time and can even appreciate in price in the secondary market.</p>
